# 🏦 Credit Risk Evaluation

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on building a foundational understanding of **risk analytics** in the **banking and financial services** industry. The objective is to analyze historical customer and loan data to identify key risk factors and help financial institutions **minimize the risk of losing money when lending to customers**.

Through a combination of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **database management**, and **interactive dashboarding**, the project offers insights into customer behavior, credit risk, and default patterns using real-world data and tools commonly used in the industry.

## 💡 Objectives

- Understand how **data-driven decision-making** helps minimize financial risk.
- Analyze customer profiles and identify factors that influence loan repayment.
- Visualize risk-related KPIs through a dynamic dashboard.
- Demonstrate the end-to-end flow from **database to dashboard** using industry tools.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed EDA in Python to uncover patterns and trends in the dataset:

- Analyzed **loan status distribution** (approved vs rejected, default vs non-default).
- Visualized **credit score**, **income**, and **loan amount** patterns.
- Identified **correlations** between repayment status and customer features.
- Detected anomalies and potential data quality issues.

All plots were generated using `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for visual storytelling.

## 🗄️ Database Integration

- The cleaned and transformed dataset was stored in a **MySQL relational database**.
- Used SQL queries to extract relevant information for dashboarding.
- Ensured data consistency and schema optimization for real-time queries.

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard

Developed a responsive and insightful **Power BI dashboard**, connected live to the MySQL database.

**Dashboard features:**
- **Loan Approval & Default Rates**
- **Customer Segmentation** by income, credit score, employment type, etc.
- **Filterable visualizations** (e.g., by region, loan type, risk category)
- **KPI cards** for total loans, default rate, average income, and more

This allows business users to:
- Identify high-risk customers before loan approval
- Make data-backed lending decisions
- Monitor portfolio risk over time

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Customers with **low credit scores** and **high debt-to-income ratios** are more likely to default.
- Certain employment types and age groups show **higher risk behavior**.
- Real-time risk monitoring can significantly reduce NPA (Non-performing Assets) rates.
